# This is FlightGear Î¼ (mju) aka mpmap.js
A Multiplayer Map for FlightGear based on node.js

## Requirements
* nodejs >= 6.0
* permission to perform DNS lookup
* permission to do outbound connects (telnet to mpserverXX on port 5001) 

## Installation
get software

	git clone https://git.code.sf.net/p/flightgear/mpmap.js flightgear-mpmap.js

enter into the directory

	cd flightgear-mpmap.js

install dependencies

	npm install

run

	npm start

This will start the server on localhost, port 8080 and you should see the multiplayer map at http://localhost:8080/

don't like 8080? Use another port like this

	app_port=4711 npm start

## Running within docker
If you have docker and docker-compose installed, simply type

	docker-compose up --build

and you are ready. Note: this exposes the app at port http://localhost:8086/
